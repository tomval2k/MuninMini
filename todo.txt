Todo list:

    NODE:
        - reimplement logging into awk script (was limited logging in shell version)
        - add timeouts to awk script

    PLUGINS:
        - rewrite some plugins
        - quota plugins to be combined
        - some new plugins?
            - want a plugin that draws a curve on the graph -perhaps sin/cos/tan from awk? ('cos it will look nice)
        - check how plugins should report errors to munin
        - plugin installation script
			- could read variables from scripts, summarise, and install based on preferences
			- needs to be able to run unattended

    MISC:
        - update readme
            - duplicate basename - only one script gets used
        - spool directory management


    - check it still works
