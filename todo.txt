Todo list:

- reimplement logging into awk script (was limited logging in shell version)
- spool directory management
- plugin installation script
- rewrite some plugins
	- quota plugins to be combined

- some new plugins?
	- want a plugin that draws a curve on the graph -perhaps sin/cos/tan from awk? ('cos it will look nice)

- update readme
	- duplicate basename - only one script gets used
- check it still works
- check how plugins should report errors to munin
